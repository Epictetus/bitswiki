= Bitswiki

There are lots of Ruby wikis.  Why another one?  Simple: this one is sweet.

Ok, thatâ€™s not exactly it.  Really we just needed a simple, fast, extensible wiki for our own internal use.  After we were done we realized that it might be useful to others, too.  So here you go.

= Features

* Tags
* Search
* Textile markdown plus enhancements for inline source code
* Revision comparison (inspired by Instiki and Writeboard)
* Recent changes listing
* RSS feeds for individual page changes or entire wiki
* Sweet scriptaculous drawer effects
* Written in Rails for easy modification
